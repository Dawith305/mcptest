1. ### What I did
Wrote simple rules telling the AI how to code similar to how a professional or myself would do it. Made it to be focused, keep changes small, respect existing code, and be clear about what it's doing.

2. ### What worked
The AI now plans before coding, makes smaller changes, explains its choices, and avoids big refactors unless asked. Testing rule worked - it wrote clean Python with docstrings and good error handling.

3. ### What didn't work

4. ### Insights gained
Good rules make the AI code more likely to do less random changes and be more thoughtful. It's not perfect but helps keep us on the same page. Small, clear rules work best.
